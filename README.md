# 🍽 Food Delivery Analytics with SQL

This project showcases *advanced SQL analytics* on a food delivery platform dataset. By querying and analyzing customer, restaurant, rider, and delivery data, the project extracts deep insights into user behavior, sales performance, restaurant growth, and operational efficiency.

---

## 🎯 Why this project?

Food delivery apps generate massive amounts of transactional and behavioral data. To make smarter business decisions, companies must track:

- customer loyalty and spending  
- restaurant revenue and growth trends  
- order cancellations and delivery efficiency  
- rider performance and earnings  

This project simulates such analyses using SQL to *answer real-world business questions* from a delivery platform’s perspective.

## 🌐 Real-world context

Imagine a food delivery platform (like Swiggy, Zomato, or Uber Eats) that wants to optimize its ecosystem by analyzing:

- *customers*: ordering frequency, churn, lifetime value  
- *restaurants*: top revenue drivers, growth ratios, popular dishes  
- *riders*: delivery times, efficiency, earnings, and ratings  
- *operations*: cancellations, peak demand slots, and seasonal demand  

This SQL project provides *end-to-end analytical insights* to help businesses optimize marketing, operations, and growth.

---

## 🧭 Project Overview

This project covers *20 real-world business questions* implemented in SQL, spanning across:

- 📊 *Customer Analytics*: top customers, churn, lifetime value, segmentation  
- 🍔 *Restaurant Insights*: revenue ranking, growth rates, dish popularity  
- 🚴 *Rider Performance*: average delivery time, monthly earnings, star ratings  
- 🛠 *Operational Analysis*: cancellations, peak demand slots, seasonal trends

## 📋 Project Requirements

The project primarily involves *SQL queries* on five core tables:

- *customers* – customer profiles  
- *restaurants* – restaurant details  
- *orders* – order transactions  
- *deliveries* – delivery tracking with times and status  
- *riders* – rider information  

### Key SQL Deliverables

- *Customer Behavior*  
  - Top dishes ordered by a customer  
  - Average order value (AOV) per customer  
  - High-value customers (>3k spend)  
  - Customer churn analysis (2023 vs 2024)  
  - Customer segmentation (Gold vs Silver)  
  - Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)  

- *Restaurant Analysis*  
  - Top 5 revenue-generating restaurants (last year)  
  - Restaurant cancellation rate (year-over-year)  
  - Monthly growth ratios of delivered orders  
  - Popular dishes across restaurants  
  - Restaurant ranking by revenue  

- *Order & Delivery Insights*  
  - Popular ordering time slots  
  - Orders placed but not delivered  
  - Order frequency by weekday (peak day detection)  
  - Seasonal demand spikes (Spring/Summer/Winter)  
  - Monthly sales trends  

- *Rider Performance*  
  - Rider average, min, and max delivery time  
  - Rider efficiency (fastest vs slowest)  
  - Monthly rider earnings (8% commission model)  
  - Rider ratings (based on delivery time → 5★, 4★, 3★)
